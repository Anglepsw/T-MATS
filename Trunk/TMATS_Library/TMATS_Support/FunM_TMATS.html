<font size="6" color="Magenta">T-MATS: MATLAB functions</font>
<p>The T-MATS package contains MATLAB functions for doing certain Thermodynamic operations. Information about these sets of functions are located in the users manual.</p>
<p>As a quick reference the T-MATS functions are also located below. They can be accessed by using the class structure TMATS.* .</p>
<p> Units consist of:<br>
    temperature - R<br>
    pressure - psia<br>
    enthalpy = BTU/lbm<br>
    entropy - BTU/(lbm*R)<br>
FAR - NA</p>
