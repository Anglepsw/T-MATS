<font size="6" color="Magenta">T-MATS: Bleed Library Block</font>
<br>
This block extracts bleed flows from the main stream or combines flows into the main stream. 
It should be noted that this block is meant for small bleed flows. Inflows are introduced 
to the main flow as to preserve total mass flow and total enthalpy, however momentum calculations 
are not performed. Outflows are defined fractionally based on the main input flow.
<br><br> Input bleed is added to the main flow at station 1 of the block:
$$ W_{s1} = W_{In} + \sum W_{bleed} $$
Station 1 total enthalpy is a summation of all input flow enthlapies
$$ Ht_{s1} = ht_{In}*W_{In} + \sum Ht_{bleed} $$
Because bleed flows are assumed to be relatively small, station 1 pressure is assumed to be equal to the input main flow pressure
    $$P_{s1} = P_{In} $$
    Each output bleed flow is a fraction of the main flow
    $$W_{bleedout} = C_{Wfrac} * W_{In} $$
    $$W_{out} = W_{s1} - W_{bleedout} $$
    All other output flow parameters are condered the same as for station 1.
