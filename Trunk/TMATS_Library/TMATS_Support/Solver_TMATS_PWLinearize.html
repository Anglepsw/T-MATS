<font size="6" color="Magenta">T-MATS: Piecewise Linear Model Generator Library Block</font>
<br>
<p>
This block operates the inputs of a system to automatically create a piecewise linear model of that system.
<br>
The linear model generated is in the form:
</p>
$$
(\dot{X} - \dot{X}_0) = A*(X - X_0) + B*(U - U_0)$$
$$(Y - Y_0) = C*(X - X_0) + D*(U - U_0)$$
<br>
<p>
    Where X is the system state, U is the system input, and Y is the plant output.
    0 values are the trim point values. This block assumes U is dimension 1x1. Other plant effectors will be taken into account with the Env variables.
</p>
<p>    
    This block attempts to characterize a system by creating many linear models at different operating points. To do this, system inputs (Env and U) or operating points
    will be generated and fed to the system dynamically. Transitions between the operating points will be governed by quasi-steady state slewing. Once slewing to a new operating point is complete
    the block will wait until the system has reached steady-state then freeze the state integrator and perform a linearization. Once complete the block will re-engage the state integrator and begin
    slewing to the next operating point. As the linear models are generated they will be stored in a file called "LinPW_TMATS.mat".

</p>
<p>
    Block operation is governed by two main functions, dynamic slewing and linearization.
    Linearization is handled by the T-MATS linearization block with documentation located <a href="Solver_TMATS_Linearize.html">here</a>. <br>
    Dynamic slewing is performed to operate the system model to the operating points defined by the Env and U inputs. The U input
    can be managed directly by checking DCntrlEn and changing TVec or it can be updated to a control signal by unchecking DCntrlEn and changing TVec to become target control values.
    When DCntrlEn is unchecked the Cntrlsen block input appears. Cntrlsen should be assigned an appropriate system output that is effected by U. A proportunal integral (PI) controller is then used to
    drive the system to the target control value by updating U.
